:amphora: **tesselle** is a collection of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) packages for research and teaching in archaeology.

These packages focus on quantitative analysis methods developed for archaeology and can be used to explore and analyze common data types in archaeology: count data, compositional data and chronological data. The **tesselle** packages are designed to work seamlessly together and to complement general-purpose and other specialized statistical packages.

Install the complete suite with:

```r
install.packages("tesselle")
```
